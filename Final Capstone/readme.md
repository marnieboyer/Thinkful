Thank you for checking out my project.

These are my files:


MAIN v2 - Has all of my main code for this project, including visualizations

FUNCTIONS ONLY - as the name suggests, has the functions I use in MAIN v2

SCRAPE GOOGLE IMAGES - I used this to quickly scrape/download images of celebrities' faces from Google and storing to my PC.
