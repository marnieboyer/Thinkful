Including:
1. Two versions of something whose effects will be compared. 
2. A sample, divided into two groups. 
3. A hypothesis. 
4. Outcome(s) of interest.
5. Other measured variables.

A. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
1. I would test this by providing one group the new supplement and the other group a placebo.  Note, if this is a "new supplement", 
I may also want to test it against an "old supplement" which would determine if "new" is better than "old". I am using a placebo to
ensure people don't know which group they are in and therefore bias the samples.
2. I would recruit people for my study and split them randomly into two groups.
3. My hypothesis is that the new supplement will help people sleep better than the placebo.
4. Outcome would be number of hours of sleep, net of any restless times (as measured by a FitBit device)
5.Other measured variables would be: continuous hours of sleep, number of times restless, time to fall asleep, reported side effects, 
self-reported feeling of restfulness

B. Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
1. I would test this by having the people at the gym wear uniforms instead of their own clothes.
2. Have them wear the uniforms for a month,
3. Sales will be better with the uniforms.
4. Gym memberships - compared to last year's sales, accounting for recent trends (i.e., if sales were up 10% year over year this year, 
I would use that 10% increase as the baseline)
5. Other revenue, renewals, mix of membership types sold

C. Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
1. New homepage vs. old homepage
2. Divide visitors randomly by displaying each homepage to them.  Use a tool like optimizely, for example.
3. The new homepage will improve sales.
4. Rentals of exotic pets.
5. Repeat visitors, time on site, bounce rate, interest forms, emails collected

D. If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?
1. One version of subject with 'please read' and one version with all of the same words except no "please read"
2. Randomly select recipients using ESP's functionality.
3. 'Please read' will increase open rate of email.
4. Open rate
5. Click rate, unsubscribe rate, number of times open
